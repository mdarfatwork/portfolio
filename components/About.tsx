          I&apos;m a self-taught web developer who learned through YouTube, practice,
          and continuous coding. Currently, I&apos;m working as a Junior Web
          Developer with Luis, where I focus on building modern applications
          using MERN, Next.js, TypeScript, and PostgreSQL. I&apos;m passionate
          about growing as a developer and open to remote opportunities where I
          can contribute, learn, and build impactful products.
